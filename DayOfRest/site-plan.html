			President Russell M. Nelson taught: “I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a sign between me and my Heavenly Father. With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don’ts. When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, I simply asked myself, ‘What sign do I want to give to God?’ That question made my choices about the Sabbath day crystal clear.”

			1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
			2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
			3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. Genesis 3:1-3
